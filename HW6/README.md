# Homework_Assignment_6

Please see our Topic 6 Lecture Slide # 53 for the details of the HW6. You could still use the same input we have been using: 

    int N = 8;
    double U = 1.15125, D = 0.86862, R = 1.00545;
    double S0 = 106.00, K = 100.00;

The output should be written to a file. An example of output file is attached in the homework assignment 6 (NYU Brightspace)
